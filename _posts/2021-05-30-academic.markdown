### academic

A Jekyll theme designed for academia, although you can use it for almost any other purpose as well:

* Showcase your research interests, publications, your curriculum vitae, the people in your research group, and your contact information.

* Manage courses that you are teaching.

* Provide updates to your students and faulty.

For everything you would ever need to know, please visit [the repository](https://github.com/LeNPaul/academic) and check out [the demo site](https://lenpaul.github.io/academic/).
