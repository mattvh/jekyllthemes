# OneFlow Jekyll Theme

## What is it
OneFlow is a Jekyll Theme designed to create stunning, clear and practical modern One-Pager Websites. 
It offers lots of features and customization options, so you can easily create a Site that matches your own or your client's wishes for design and structure.  
Check out the [Theme Website](https://oneflow-jekyll-theme.github.io/) showcasing and explaining the various opportunities the theme offers, and also check out the [first example website](https://oneflow-jekyll-theme-example-one.github.io/) and the [second example website](https://oneflow-jekyll-theme-example-two.github.io/) to see a few of the different design options the theme offers.  

## Full documentation

## Getting started & development 

### Fork and clone this repository
The **vision of this theme** is **simplicity and accessibility**, to easily create stunning websites from scratch.  
Therefore, it's not available as a classic gem-based Jekyll theme, but as a ready-to-use GitHub repository that you just need to fork and clone.  
So, get ahead and make a fork of this repository, rename it if you like to suit the name of the site you want to create, locally clone it, and directly start editing!

### How to start a development docker container
To test your website and see all of your changes in real-time without deploying it online, you can easily build your site locally.  
- Make sure you have [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.  
- Open up a terminal, navigate to your local repository, and run ```docker compose up```.

Your site will then be visible at ```http://0.0.0.0:4000/``` in any browser.
