## Much-Worse Jekyll Theme for academic page and blog

This is a modified version of [Steve Miller's NGVM theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/svm-ngvb/).
I prefer large seriff fonts with minimal coloring and styling. Apart
form the typography, color scheme and layout, this theme has two useful
changes:

- It allows you to maintain your website as a subdirectory on your
university of company domain (e.g.
http://university.edu/department/people/your-website). Most Jekyll
blogs are designed to be hosted at custom domain names.

- Most jekyll themes are blog-centric, or single page websites. This
theme lets you create multi-page website with a blog if you want.

Both the above are not seminal achievements in science, but they are
useful. This theme also supports site analytics including
[Statcounter](http://statcounter.com) and major comment providers for
blogs.

See it in action [here](http://people.csail.mit.edu/gchauras).
