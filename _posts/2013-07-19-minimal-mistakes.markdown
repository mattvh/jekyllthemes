A minimal Jekyll theme that is all about:

* Responsive templates. Looking good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* Gracefully degrading in older browsers. Compatible with Internet
  Explorer 8+ and all modern browsers.
* Minimal embellishments. Content first.
* Author bio sidebar with social networking links.
* Large feature images for posts and pages.
