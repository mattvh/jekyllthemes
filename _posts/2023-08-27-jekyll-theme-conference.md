This is a responsive [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme based on [Bootstrap 4](http://getbootstrap.com) for conferences. It contains

- multiday program / schedule,
- talk and speaker descriptions,
- map for directions,
- realtime live indications during the conference, and
- supports embedded video streaming or recordings.

All components such as talks, speakers or rooms are represented as collection of files. The schedule is given is defined via a simple structure stored in a [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file. There is no need for databases and once generated the website consists only of static files. A script and workflows are available for easy import, e.g. of [frab](https://github.com/frab/frab/wiki/Manual#introduction) compatible schedules.
The design is easily customizable and is adapted for mobile uses and printing.

The theme was originally created for the yearly Winterkongress conference of the [Digital Society Switzerland](https://digitale-gesellschaft.ch/). You can see this theme in action here:
