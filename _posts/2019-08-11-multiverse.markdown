## Multiverse
Multiverse is a slick one-page gallery design with a fully functional lightbox and a custom reusable panel system.

Template originally by [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net) / [@ajlkn](https://github.com/ajlkn). Adapted to Jekyll by [@joaomlneto](https://joao.neto.pt)

## Adding Content
Each of the images displayed in the website is its own separate *post*:
- Metadata (image title and caption) goes in the `_images` folder
- Actual images (thumbnails and full-resolution images go into `assets/images`).
