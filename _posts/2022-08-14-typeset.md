Typeset is an elegant, minimalistic Jekyll blogging theme based on [poole](https://github.com/poole/poole/tree/gh-pages). Since poole hasn't been updated in a long time, and it has some minor bugs and missing features. So I made minor modifications based on it to make the [CJK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_characters) fonts typesetting more beautiful, added support for mathematical formulas, and fixed some minor bugs.

Typeset is a blog theme designed for minimalists with focused content without any distractions to the reading experience.

## Features
- Responsive Design
- RSS feed (link [here](https://typesetting.vercel.app/atom.xml))
- Math formula support (view in [example post](https://typesetting.vercel.app/page4))
- Dark Mode (based on the system theme)
- [Archive](https://typesetting.vercel.app/archive), tags features (easy to add yourself)

- GitHub gist embed support and more...
