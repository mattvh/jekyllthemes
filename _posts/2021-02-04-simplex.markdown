A blog theme I've developed for my blog. The theme is simple but full of useful features. Some of the features are:
- responsivity
- automatic dark mode
- Open Graph tags support (link preview image)
- built-in buttons
- built-in lightbox

The theme is licensed under MIT, so feel free to add more features or edit.
It is packaged as a gem, so it can be installed easily with bundle.
More information and installation steps are in the [repository](https://github.com/andreondra/jekyll-theme-simplex).

Enjoy!
