A jekyll theme for photographers. It's the first theme to show EXIF data on pictures.

## Features
- Single page
- Photography
- Shows EXIF data
- Social links

## Highlights
- To add new pictures, you need to just upload them. No code changes required.
- This I like the most, you get to see EXIF data like aperture, shutter speed, iso etc when you click on any image automagically.
