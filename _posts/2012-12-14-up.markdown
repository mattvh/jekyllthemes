# Up

Up is a clean and beautiful [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) based layout
for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

This is designed to be an easy layout to modify for your own blog. It is
based on [zachholman's](http://zachholman.com/) blog themes: the "old" one, now
opensourced as [left](http://github.com/holman/left), and also in his actual
theme, that's not opensource (I believe), but I stole some ideas anyway. I also
took something from [jekyll-bootstrap](https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap),
and, of course, I'm using [bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap) as
a base for whole thing.

## Installation

- [Fork this repository](https://github.com/caarlos0/up/fork)
- Rename it to `YOUR-USER.github.io`
- Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USER/YOUR-USER.github.io`
- With Ruby, bundler, Node.js and NPM previously installed, run the init script
`bundle && rake init`;
- Start it up in watch mode: `foreman start -f Procfile.dev`.

You should have a server up and running locally at <http://localhost:4000>.

## Customization

Next you'll want to change a few things. The list of files you may want to
change is the following:

- [_config.yml](https://github.com/caarlos0/up/blob/gh-pages/_config.yml): Put
your config there, almost everything will be up and running.
- [about/index.html](https://github.com/caarlos0/up/blob/gh-pages/about/index.html):
Well, that's about you, I would change it if I were you... OH WAIT!
- [CNAME](https://github.com/caarlos0/up/blob/gh-pages/CNAME): If you're using
this on GitHub Pages with a custom domain name, you might want to change this to be
the domain you're going to use. All that should be in here is a
domain name on the first line and nothing else (like: `example.com`).
- [favicon.ico](https://github.com/caarlos0/up/blob/gh-pages/favicon.ico): This
is a smaller version of my gravatar for use as the icon in your browser's
address bar. You may change it to whatever you like. [Updating your icons][up-icons].
- [apple-touch-icon.jpg](https://github.com/caarlos0/up/blob/gh-pages/apple-touch-icon.jpg):
Again, this is my gravatar, and it shows up in iOS and various other apps
that use this file as an "icon" for your site. [Updating your icons][up-icons].

### Custom CSS/JS

Assets are now managed by bower. You could simply run `grunt` whenever you
want to update your assets. `grunt watch` will also watch everything for
changes.

Note: I'm not using any Jekyll asset pipeline because it's not supported
by [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com), so, I prefer to do it by myself.


### Update `favicon` and `apple-precomposed` icons based on gravatar

First, be sure you have the author email configured in `_config.yml`,
then, just run:

```sh
rake icons
```

The script will generate your email hash and get your gravatar, then, using
RMagick, it will create all needed icons.


## Deployment

You should deploy with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com)- it's just
easier.

All you should have to do is to rename your repository on GitHub to be
`username.github.io`. Since this is a Jekyll project, you
should be able to see your new site at <http://username.github.io>.
