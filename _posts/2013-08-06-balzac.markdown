This is built on [Semantic.gs](http://semantic.gs/) grid framework which I edited a bit to make it fluid. It was forked from the wonderful [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) by Michael Rose.

I hope you enjoy using, forking, whatevering this theme as much as I did making it. 

### Features
* flexible, uses max-width for responsive goodness
* responsive drop down menu
* retina images using @2x
* post loop in the footer showing 3 latest post
* custom portfolio page for case studies
