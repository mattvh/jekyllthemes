**consolo** aims the recreate the rugged look of a terminal/console interface while maintaining legibility.

It is forked from [jekyll-theme-console](https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console) which, as far as I can tell, is no longer maintained.
**consolo** refines the general look of the original theme, standardizes content, and greatly improves on extensibility. 
Parts of the installation guide also come from the original theme.
