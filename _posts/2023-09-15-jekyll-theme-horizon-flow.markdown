Horizon-Flow is a mobile friendly Jekyll theme characterized by a serene color palette of blue, gray, and orange. It features a clean, sidebar-free layout, keeping all content in a single, flowing main container. The header remains fixed even while scrolling, ensuring easy navigation. Allows Custom content to be displayed in the footer and footer-sidebar.
