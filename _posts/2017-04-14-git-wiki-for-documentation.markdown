it’s a full featured wiki powered by git, jekyll (github pages) and pull-requests!

It means:

* Improvements in the cooperative aspect: forks, pull-requests and roles.
* You can customize your wiki as you want with style sheets and even changing the layout.
* No databases! Only static files that can be downloaded in a few seconds.
* Markdown and html mixed together!
* History, revision comparison and everything you need from a wiki platform.
* You can edit your pages with the standard git editor, prose.io (integrated) or any kind of editor you prefer.
* You can fork/copy the master branch now and start your wiki in just 1 minute.

Then share your wiki with us! please.

Note: You can even include the github wiki as a submodule and enable the conf, but it’s an experimental feature and it implies less advantages and greater disadvantages for now.
