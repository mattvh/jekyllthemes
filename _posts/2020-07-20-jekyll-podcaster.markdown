Jekyll Podcaster is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme built for podcasters. Every podcast needs a great website and this theme helps you achieve that.

Please note that this theme will not build a RSS feed for your podcast, meaning that this is just for showcasing your podcast and not for distributing it. You still need to use a distribution platform.
