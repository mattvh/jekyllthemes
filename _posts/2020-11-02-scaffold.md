Scaffold is a *one-column minimalist Jekyll theme for bloggers*.

According to [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/), a *scaffold* is

> a temporary or movable platform for workers (such as bricklayers, painters, or miners) to stand or sit on when working at a height above the floor or ground

So is the target of the Jekyll theme Scaffold. It doesn't need to be modern, powerful, colorful, or beautiful; It just needs to be **simple**, **proper**, **naked**, and **neat**.

Scaffold is empirical. Standing on it, you -- the blogger -- can build a great building based on your words.
