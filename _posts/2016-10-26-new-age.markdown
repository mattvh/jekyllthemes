New Age Jekyll theme
====================

Jekyll theme based on
[New Age bootstrap theme ](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/new-age/)

# Demo
View this jekyll theme in action [here](https://jekynewage.github.io/)

## Built by
[Antonio Trento](https://it.linkedin.com/in/antoniotrento)

This Jekyll template was created to develop, landing pages, squeeze
pages, portfolio and blog or all the above.

###I integrated analytical tools and marketing such as:
- Google analytics
- Disqus comment system
- Add This social sharing

External stylesheets and libraries included are Google Fonts, Font
Awesome, Normalize.CSS, and WOW.js.

In order to set your log data to applications _config.yml just open the
file and find the associated items.

I also built a system to add their own names on the same company files.

**To change the base colors yellow go in css folder there main.css
where you can set the primary color and the secondary color, remember
that the theme is gradient in the background areas.**
