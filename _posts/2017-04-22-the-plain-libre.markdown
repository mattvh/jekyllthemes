A fork of [The Plain](https://github.com/heiswayi/the-plain) which relies on 
100% free software, does not include any Javascript and the font used is 
served from the local instance. This theme also features a fully static 
commenting system and lots of [other stuff](https://github.com/frnmst/the-plain-libre#this-version-compared-to-the-original-one-1443d83).

It has been tested on Parabola GNU/Linux-libre.
