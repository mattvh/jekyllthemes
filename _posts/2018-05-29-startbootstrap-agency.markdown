jekyll-theme-startbootstrap-agency is a Jekyll theme based on Start Bootstrap - Agency.

"Agency is a stylish, one page Bootstrap theme for agencies and small businesses. The design of Agency is based off of the Golden PSD Theme by Mathavan Jaya. You can download the PSD verison of this theme at FreebiesXpress.com."

The objective of this project is to provide a Jekyll theme that is line by line perfect replica of “Startbootstrap - Agency” and at the same time to be so dynamic that can be used as a starting point for child themes.
