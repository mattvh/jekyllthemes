# Jekyller [![Build Status][build]][build-link]
[build]: https://travis-ci.org/shower/jekyller.png?branch=gh-pages
[build-link]: https://travis-ci.org/shower/jekyller

This is a generator for the
[Shower HTML presentation engine](https://github.com/shower/shower).

It takes your markdown document and transforms it into the Shower
slides. Almost all the things are transformed smoothly, however there
could be some things you could configure, either in the YAML front
matter or using some extra special formatting.

## Install

### At GitHub Pages

Jekyll Shower works at GitHub Pages. Yes, it's using Jekyll and don't
need any extra plugins, so using it is really staightforward:

1. [Fork this repo.](https://github.com/shower/jekyller/fork_select)
2. Make any changes to it (like change your username and all those
   stuff in the `_config.yml`). You can do it right on the GitHub, btw.
3. Commit & Push the changes — GitHub would initialise Pages only on
   the first push after the forking action. That could take up to 10
   minutes.

That's all — after doing so you could go at your generated pages —
replace there the `username` with your username:
`http://username.github.com/jekyller/`, and you'll see Jekyll-generated
example of the Shower presentation.

### Local usage

If you'd like to preview the changes or compile it locally, so you'd
have static HTML of your slides (and you could access them without an
internet access), you should clone this repo (or a fork) locally:

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/shower/jekyller.git

Note that you'll need either to use the `--recursive` flag, 'cause
there are submodules to fetch, or you'll need to use `git submodule
init && git submodule update` in order to fetch them manually if you
didn't use this flag.

After cloning all you'll need to do is to run Jekyll in the cloned
folder. On how to install and run Jekyll
[read it's readme](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll#getting-started).

## Use

The basic usage is very simple. After you'll configure everything up in
the `_config.yml` (I recommend you do so: you should at least change
the default `author` entry), you could begin making your slides.

Look at the `index.md` for an example of how you can describe your
slides. Your markdown document should need the YAML front matter like
this:

``` YAML
---
layout: default
---
```

That's the minimal front-matter you need. You could configure it later.

Note that you don't need to place your title here — Jekyller would get
it from the first `H1` found in your markdown document (actually, at
the moment, you _need_ to have the first-level header to go right after
the YAML front matter).

So, you just write

``` md
# You slides’ title
```

And get this as a title for your slides as well as make this slide a
cover for the whole presentation.

If you won't want to make this slide a cover, but a generic slide, just
add a `.slide` class (however, I think you'd rarely would want this —
covers are nice!):

``` md
# You slides’ title
{:.slide}
```

Everything else goes smoothly: use second level headers to divide the
content into the slides and all the other tags inside to make your
presentation.

I'll describe there all the things you could do in your presentation,
as well as all the available options later in this Readme, so stay
tuned!

## Configure

### Change theme

By default Jekyller comes with the [ribbon theme](https://github.com/shower/ribbon)
applied to all new slides. If you wish to change the default theme,
change the `default_theme` variable in
[config](https://github.com/shower/jekyller/_config.yml#L9).

Right now only two themes are available: `ribbon` and
[`bright`](https://github.com/shower/bright).

Themes are attached as submodules, so if you'd like to add your own
great theme for Shower so anyone could use it with Jekyller, just send
a pull request with it! However, don't forget that it should be
attached via git read-only url — `git://` — in order to work under
GitHub Pages.

And if you'd like to change theme per presentation, just define `theme`
variable in YAML front matter or refefine the `layout` one with the one
you want to use, so to use `bright` theme your minimal front matter
would look like this:

``` YAML
---
layout: bright
---
```

### Author info

I know you'd like to change the default placeholdered author info for
your slides. This is also is manageble through
[config](https://github.com/shower/jekyller/_config.yml#L13), look at
the `author` object there. It have multiple sub-properties like `name`,
`url` for your blog/twitter/etc. and a field for your company. Change
it!

And, of course, you could change those thing per presentation in YAML
front matter. And while the syntax in config is rather strict, in YAML
you could use a lot of variants, like not using the url or company, so
this would be ok:

``` YAML
---
layout: default
author: John Smith
---
```

### Language

There is a `default_lang` variable in
[config](https://github.com/shower/jekyller/_config.yml#L10), it's
defaulted to `en`, but there is also `ru` supported for Russian. It
don't do much, for now it changes the style of list markers and quotes.

Of course, it's available to redefine per-presentation in YAML front
matter as a `lang` variable.

### Body class

By default Shower page opens in list mode, but if you'd like to open in
fullscreen mode from the start (to avoid spoilers, for example), you
can change the class on `body` to `full` either redefining the
`default_body_class: full` in
[config](https://github.com/shower/jekyller/_config.yml#L11), either
using `body_class: full` in YAML front matter.

### Progress bar

If you'd like to disable the progress bar, just set the `progress` (in
[config](https://github.com/shower/jekyller/_config.yml#L21) or in YAML
front matter) to `false`.

### More configuration option coming

[Issues](https://github.com/shower/jekyller/issues)!

## Features

### GitHub Pages support

See [install](https://github.com/shower/jekyller/#install) notes on how
you can use Shower with Jekyller in just a few easy steps.

### Minimalist markdown

#### The title of the slides

As mentioned above in the
[use](https://github.com/shower/jekyller/#use) section, the only thing
that need be there other than YAML front matter is a title made of a
markdown first level header:

``` md
# Some slides
```

That's it, nothing more!

#### Slides

Every other slide should start from the second level header, just like
this:

``` md
## I'm a slide!
```

You don't need to recreate or think on Shower's HTML structure, you
just delimit the slides using headers, easy as this.

##### id for the slide

By default the slide would take an `id` from it's content, almost like
in GitHub-flavored markdown. But if you want to override it, you could
use the syntax [kramdown](http://kramdown.rubyforge.org) (which is used
for Jekyller) provides, like this:

``` md
## I'm a slide! {#Foo}
```

In this way the slide would have `id="Foo"` instead.

##### Shouting

If you'd like to _shout_ (use the `shout` class on a slide), you could
just wrap the content of a header with `strong`:


```md
## **You can even shout this way**
```

This would make such slide a `shout` one.

##### Extra classes or attributes

Another way to add stuff to a slide is to use a more general syntax
(`{:…}`) from kramdown for adding different attributes.

Just add any of them to the header and they would propagate to the
slide. Like this:

``` md
## Pictures
{:.cover #Picture}
```

or

``` md
{:.shout data-timing="00:03"}
## You can even shout this way
```

In the first example you can see how we make a “cover” from a slide
adding `.cover` class, and also when you're using this syntax you need
to move `id` reference inside it, so you can't use the on-line one
above with adding other attributes.

In the second example you can see another variant of the attributes
block usage — you can place it either after or before the heading, it
doesn't matter to kramdown, so use it as you like. In this second
example you can see how you can set any custom attributes from there.

##### Covers with images

If you'd like to have a cover without header, just use an image inside
a header like this:

``` md
## ![](https://github.com/shower/jekyller/pictures/picture.jpg)
{:.cover}
```

Also, Shower engine allows you to say if the image should be fit to the
width or height using the classes of `.w` for width and `.h` for
height. Like this:

``` md
## ![](https://github.com/shower/jekyller/pictures/picture.jpg)
{:.cover .h}
```

#### Tables

As Jekyller is using kramdown engine, you can use the
[kramdown syntax for tables](http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/syntax.html#tables).

Briefly, you can use them like that::

``` md
|  Locavore      | Umami       | Helvetica | Vegan     |
+----------------|-------------|-----------|-----------+
|* Fingerstache *| Kale        | Chips     | Keytar    |
|* Sriracha     *| Gluten-free | Ennui     | Keffiyeh  |
|* Thundercats  *| Jean        | Shorts    | Biodiesel |
|* Terry        *| Richardson  | Swag      | Blog      |
```

You can see a little difference from the kramdown syntax: there is now
a way to make `th`s with row scope: just start and end the cell with
asterisks:

``` md
|* Fingerstache *|
```

#### Code with line numbers

By default Jekyller would add line numbers to your code blocks. If
you'd like to disable this, add `line_numbers: false` to your YAML
front matter or toggle the global variable in the `_config.yml`.

#### Presenter notes

In Shower the presenter notes are made by using `<footer>` tag.
Jekyller provides you a convenient way to write short ones — just write
them like this:

``` md
// I'm a presenter note!
```

That's it — a line starting with `//` followed by one optional space
would be wrapped by `<footer>`.

However, if you'd want more complex note, you'd need to use plain html
`<footer>`, 'cause there is no way to place anything block-level inside
this “comment” right now.

#### Embedded HTML

Of course even extended by kramdown markdown syntax don't have
everything in it. So if you'd like to add something _extra_, you could
just use plain HTML there. Like this:

``` md
<figure markdown="1">

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do
eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad
minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip
ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in
voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur
sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia.

<figcaption>Marcus Tullius Cicero</figcaption>
</figure>
```

Also, kramdown is somewhat smart about the html, so when you open a tag
it won't treat anything inside as markdown. You can change this by
using kramdown-specific attribute `markdown="1"`, so everything inside
would be rendered as markdown.

#### Attributes blocks

As mentioned in the part on extra classes for slides, kramdown adds a
way to add any attributes to markdown tags. For block-level entities
add `{:…}` at the line above or beyond the block, for inline blocks use
it at the start of its content, so for marking list items to have inner
navigation you can use this:

``` md
1. Lets you reveal list items one by one
2. {:.next}To keep some key points
3. {:.next}In secret from audience
4. {:.next}But it will work only once
5. {:.next}Nobody wants to see the same joke twice
```

#### Shortcut for `.next` list items

As you can see above, the syntax for making `.next` to list items is
not that convenient. That's why we added a way to write it easy and
fast: use three dots (or an ellipsis symbol) at the beginning of a list
item (optionally followed by a space character) and you'd get this
class automatically:

``` md
1. Lets you reveal list items one by one
2. …To keep some key points
3. …In secret from audience
4. …But it will work only once
5. …Nobody wants to see the same joke twice
```

See, it's so much better and readable now. And as we already mentioned,
there are few ways you could write those ellipsis, choose any style you
like, they're equal:

``` md
1. Lets you reveal list items one by one
2. ...To keep some key points
3. ... In secret from audience
4. …But it will work only once
5. … Nobody wants to see the same joke twice
```

And if you'd like to use an actual ellpsis and not to have it
transformed to `.next`, just escape it like this: `\…` (or `...` if
you're using plain dots).

#### A lot more coming soon!

Some of those examples would be made easier in the feature — we're
planning on extending the markdown syntax with shower-specific things,
so you could easier mark shouts, `<mark>` inside code blocks and other
stuff. Stay tuned!

### Organize your presentations

With Jekyller you can have all your presentations in one place: just
create a new `.md` file in the project, add a proper YAML front matter
as mentioned above and start writing you slides!
