CRT Monochrome is a minimalist text-first Jekyll theme aimed at mimicking the old monochrome CRT screens of the 70s and 80s. I developed this to use for the IrisSec Computer Hacking Club website and am releasing this under the MIT license so that anyone can use it for free.

## Features

- Truly minimalist test-based retro monochrome CRT design complete with subtle bloom, screen door, and flickering effects.
- Home, About, Members, Contact, and Articles pages.
- Sortable articles, custom categories, and user profiles.
- Automatically updating home page with the latest announcement.
- Post information sections that automatically hyperlink to categories and authors.
- Fast-loading, cool-looking design.
