[Ultra-Minimalista](https://brxyxncorp.github.io/ultra-minimal-theme/)
is a Jekyll theme that supports **multi-page websites**, and it's not
full responsive, 'cause was my first theme.

Ultra-Minimalista is useful if...

* You want to create an "about me" page from a single markdown file and
  host it under a custom domain name.
* You want to write blog from markdown file.
* You want something like GitHub's [automatic page
  generator](http://pages.github.com/) for a non-code repository.
